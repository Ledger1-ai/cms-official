It uses a drag-and-drop interface powered by the **Puck** editor.\n\n## Getting Started\n1.  Navigate to **CMS > Landing Pages** or **CMS > Blog**.\n2.  Click **Create New** or select an existing item to edit.\n3.  Click the **\"Edit Visual\"** button to launch the Puck editor.\n\n## Component Deep Dive\nKey properties for our most popular blocks:\n\n| Component | Key Properties | usage Tip |\n|-----------|----------------|-----------|\n| **Hero** | `Title`, `Subtitle`, `Background Image`, `CTA` | Use high-res images with dark overlays for text readability. |\n| **Feature Grid** | `Columns` (2-4), `Icons`, `Cards` | Best for displaying 3-6 key selling points. |\n| **Rich Text** | `Content` (Markdown) | Use for long-form text. Supports headers, lists, and links. |\n| **Call to Action** | `Headline`, `Button Text`, `Link` | Place at the bottom of pages to drive conversion. |\n\n## Keyboard Shortcuts\nSpeed up your workflow with these hotkeys:\n- `Cmd/Ctrl + Z`: **Undo** last action.\n- `Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + Z`: **Redo** last action.\n- `Cmd/Ctrl + S`: **Save** changes (local draft).\n- `Delete/Backspace`: **Remove** selected component.\n\n## Draft vs. Published\nUnderstanding the lifecycle of your content:\n\n### Draft State\n- Changes are saved locally or to a \"draft\" slot in the database.\n- **Not visible** to public visitors.\n- Perfect for work-in-progress.\n\n### Published State\n- The \"Live\" version of the page.\n- Clicking **Publish** pushes your current Draft to Production.\n- **Audit Log**: Every publish event is recorded in the Activity Log for accountability.\n\n## Mobile Preview\nAlways test responsiveness before publishing:\n1.  Click the **device icons** in the editor toolbar.\n2.  Toggle between Desktop, Tablet, and Mobile views.\n3.  Check that content reflows properly on smaller screens.",

You can add links, nested dropdowns, and organize the structure without code changes.\n\n## Accessing the Header Editor\n1. Navigate to **CMS > Header** in the sidebar (under the \"Left Menu\" or \"Design\" section).\n2. You will see a tree view of your current header structure.\n\n## Adding Navigation Items\n1. Click the **Add Item** button.\n2. Choose the type of item:\n   - **Link**: A direct link to a page (e.g., `/pricing`).\n   - **Dropdown**: A container for sub-items (e.g., \"Resources\").\n3. Enter the **Label** (text displayed) and **URL** (for links).\n\n## Mobile Responsiveness\nHow headers behave on mobile devices:\n- Top-level items become the main list in the hamburger menu.\n- **Dropdowns** become collapsible accordions.\n- **Best Practice**: Ensure dropdown labels are short and clear to fit on mobile screens.\n\n## Mega Menus\nFor complex site structures:\n- While the UI shows a simple list, creating a \"Dropdown\" with *many* children can function as a mega-menu column.\n- **Limit Depth**: We recommend a maximum nesting depth of 2 levels (Header > Dropdown > Link) for usability.\n\n## Publishing Changes\nChanges made in the Header Editor do not go live immediately.\n1. Review your structure in the preview.\n2. Click the **Publish Header** button to deploy updates to the live site.\n\n> [!TIP]\n> Keep your top-level menu items to a maximum of 5-7 for best usability.",

You can **Add**, **Edit**, or **Delete** showcase items.\n\n## Animation Formats\nChoose the right format for your visual:\n- **Lottie (JSON)**: Best for vector illustrations. Small file size, scales infinitely.\n- **GIF/Video**: Best for UI captures or complex footage. Heavier file size.\n- **CSS Animation**: Best for simple state changes. Lowest performance impact.\n\n## Hydration Safety\n> [!WARNING]\n> **Client-Side Only**: Complex animations often require access to the `window` object.\n\nIf you see \"Hydration Mismatch\" errors:\n- Ensure your animation component is wrapped in a `<ClientOnly>` helper or dynamically imported with `ssr: false`.\n- The CMS handles this automatically for standard formats, but be careful when embedding custom code.\n\n## Best Practices\n- **Consistency**: Keep titles and descriptions of similar length across items.\n- **Visuals**: Use high-quality assets. If using animations, ensure they are optimized for web performance.\n- **Ordering**: Place your most impactful feature first.",

Use the \"Clear Context\" button in chats when starting a new topic to avoid sending full history.\n\n## Voice Agent (Beta)\nBasaltCMS includes a Universal Voice Agent capable of real-time voice interaction.\n\n### Enabling Voice\n1. Ensure your browser has **Microphone Permission** allowed for the CMS domain.\n2. Click the **Microphone Icon** in the sidebar or command palette.\n3.

Vendor Scanning\n1.  Go to **CMS > Media Library**.\n2.  Click the **\"Vendors\"** tab in the top right.\n3.  Click **\"Scan Card\"** (or drop the image file).\n4.  The AI will process the image for approx. 5-10 seconds.\n5.  Once complete, a new profile is created in **CMS > Vendors**.\n\n### 2. Validation & Review\n1.  Navigate to **CMS > Vendors**.\n2.  Locate the new vendor (likely marked `AMBIGUOUS`).\n3.  Click to open the profile.\n4.  Verify the extracted data against the original card.\n5.  If correct, change status to **VALIDATED**.\n\n## Common Rejection Reasons\nIf AI scanning fails or provides poor results:\n- **Blurry Image**: Re-take the photo.\n- **Glare**: Ensure no reflections block the text.\n- **Handwriting**: AI struggles with handwritten notes on cards.\n\n## Manual Override\nIf you cannot scan a card:\n1.  Go to **CMS > Vendors**.\n2.  Click **Create New** (Manual).\n3.  Type in the details yourself.\n4.  Upload the card image as a \"Document\" later for record-keeping.",
