It uses AI to extract and validate vendor data from diverse sources like business cards and invoices.\n\n## Key Concepts\n\n### Vendor Profile\nThe central record for a vendor, containing contact info, compliance status, and history.\n- **Validation Status**: `VALIDATED`, `AMBIGUOUS` (needs review), or `REJECTED`.\n- **Compliance Score**: A 0-100 score based on document completeness and history.\n\n### Documents\nVendors can have multiple compliance documents (COI, W9, Licenses).\n- **Status**: `VALID`, `MISSING`, `EXPIRED`, `PENDING_REVIEW`.\n\n## AI Scanning\nThe system includes an \"AI Scanner\" in the Media Library. Uploading a business card image automatically:\n1.  Extracts contact details (Name, Email, Phone, Company).\n2.  Performs a background check for basic compliance flags.\n3.  Creates a Draft Vendor Profile for review.",

Configurable via `.env` variables:\n    - `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`\n    - `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET`\n\n## Protecting Routes\n\n### Proxy (Replacing Middleware)\nWe use a specialized `proxy.ts` (acting as middleware) to protect the `/cms` dashboard routes. Next.js 15+ middleware changes required this shift to ensure stable session handling.\n\nAny request to `/cms/*` without a valid session token is redirected to `/login`.\n\n```typescript\n// proxy.ts\nimport { auth } from \"./auth\"\n// ... validation logic\n```",

This includes:\n- Shopify Access Tokens\n- WooCommerce Consumer Secrets\n- WordPress Application Passwords\n\nThe encryption key `API_KEY_ENCRYPTION_KEY` is injected via environment variables and never exposed to the client.\n\n### Audit Logging\nEvery interaction with the Apps system is logged to `SystemActivity` and `AppSyncLog`.\n- **Connection Events**: Logged when a user connects/disconnects an app.\n- **Sync Events**: Logged whenever content is pushed to an external provider.\n\n## Adding New Integrations\nTo add a new integration:\n1.  **Frontend**: Add a new card to `apps/page.tsx` and configure the `AppConnectModal`.\n2.  **Backend**: Implement the auth flow (OAuth or API Key) in `api/cms/apps/connect`.\n3.  **Client**: Create a new client class in `lib/apps/[provider]/client.ts` to handle content transformations.",
